<b> HTML : A </b>

We have a number of pages working and have ensured that they work with a validator (!!). We also have experienced a number of issues (??) and are highly confident in the structure of HTML pages. 

<b> CSS : B </b> 

We have ensured that there are no style tags and attributs in our HTML pages, and have gained a high level of experience with stylesheets. 

<b> JS : B </b>

We have written a large amount of script ourselves, including the routes script (!! and db!!). // should potentially touch on the number of issues involved. 

<b> PNG : A </b>

C means you've sorted out basic skills such as converting images to PNG, cropping away unwanted edges, changing resoluation
B means you've gained experience with some basic tools such as using filters or changing colours or combining existing images or creating simple shapes or filling
A means you have gained experience with some more sophisticated tools such as handling layers and transparency, or airbrushing or creating original artwork

N/A

<b> SERVER : C </b>

Our server has currently been set up by following a tutorial to set up express. 
// POSSIBLY AIM to reach a B by Wednesday submission : have to deal with port numbs / URL validation / content negotiation for old browsers / redirections to browsers/ UTF-8 

<b> DATABASE : C </b> 

// BY WEDNESDAY aiming for a B by dealing with callbacks and the below: 

As well as manually creating a database and extracting data from it in our server, we also update and insert data from the login and products pages. We update user details when they create an account, and update data based on the products that they buy. 


<b> DYNAMIC PAGES : C </b>

// BY WEDNESDAY aiming for a B: use more features of handlebars / organise in a more sophisticated way. 
We have delivered dynamic pages by inserting data into templates on the server side, and have currently created a simple dynamic delivery system.
