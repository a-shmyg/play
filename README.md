# PLAY Text Adventure Game

Website for PLAY text adventure game engine, in the style of retro 80's nerds.

<center><b> Grades estimated based on current work PRIOR TO FORMATIVE SUBMISSION. FOLLOWING INFO OUT OF DATE. </center></b>

<b> HTML : A </b>

We tried to include the XHTML tag, however after using Handlebars it does not seem to be validating. We also have experienced a number of issues (we are planning to convert to more semantic tags as opposed to divs) and are highly confident in the structure of HTML pages. 
     In order to move our HTML grade to an A, we will investigate the issues with the XHTML delivery. 
     
 : fixed XHTML delivery 
 : example issues that we've faced (ana)
 : nb no framework all done manually 
 
 TO MOVE TO A+

<b> CSS : B </b> 

We have ensured that there are no style tags and attributes in our HTML pages, and have gained a high level of experience with stylesheets. There are some bad relative measurements, currently in px measurements, which will be changed to make it responsive.  By doing so, as we are confident with CSS style, we expect this to bring our grade to an A. 

: high confidence, all manually
: examples o the CSS 
TO MOVE TO A+

<b> JS : B </b>

We have written a large amount of script ourselves. The slider script was self written, main issue with that was timing as javascript does not have native sleep() function. For our random quote generator (used to insert quotes under the PNG header, different upon each reload), we added a text file to pull quotes from, and we currently changing it from HTMLinner method which is unsafe. We are also planning on creating a demo for our game, written ourselves in javascript. We expect this will bring us to an A. 

TO MOVE TO A+ = ESPECIALLY A+ with creative game application 
high confidence, whole game written in js for client side, 
ANA - CSS animation done here!! we can add this in. Titles animated, parameter bars animated in css. 

<b> PNG : B </b>

We have used a number of tools including filters, changing colours, and creating shapes as well as the use of layers and transparency, and the creatioin of original artwork. The main background and title fonts are all original artwork created in gimp. Following steps to reproduce main logo images:

Pexels.com for a large resolution Creative Commons license (no attribution required for personal or commercial purposes) as the space background. 3 groups of layers created, one for font, one for grid, one for background.
Grid group:
Generate a grid render.
Use perspective tool to stretch it out as if going into the distance.
Neon filter with drop shadow to create the glowing effect.
Create a horizonal path using path tool. 
Stroke path, 20px, same neon filter to create the glow for the horizon.

Duplicate and rotate those two layers to make the above grid as well.

Background group:
Create a custom purple gradient.
Set the layer type to Pin Light.
This makes sure the light bleeds through and the dark is dyed purple.

Font group:
Download free for personal use 80's style font.
Create two transparent layers
Create another layer, set to multiply (to "dye" the font underneath).
Add custom linear gradient with different colours to give 80's effect.
Make a new layer group so border does not interefere with text.
Select by colour tool on the font, create a new layer.
Stroke by select on that layer to create a border, 15px.
Neon effect on border, add another metallic gradient layer and set to multiply.

Over top of everything add layer with wide radial black->transparent gradient.
This creates a soft vignette and adds more focus into the centre.

<b> SVG : A </b>

All SVG images created from scratch using various features such as shape tools, freehand drawing, simplification, grouping, gradients. Each logo required significant effort to create. 

Follow steps to recreate the home logo: 

Create a rectangle shape using shape tools. Draw the 'roof' using freehand drawing tools. Path edited to include the roof. Border size decreased and filled with radial gradiant. Door added by adding new rectangle shape with transparent background, nodes adjusted and path edited around the door to move the border around the door. Similar steps used to create the window with transparent background and border similar to outside border used. Background filled with linear gradiant from blue to pink. All shapes grouped together to create a singular logo. Nodes simplified at the end to smooth image. 

<b> SERVER : C </b>

Our server has currently been set up by following a tutorial to set up express. We have been looking in to https self signed certificates, cookie session management, and will also deal with port numbers/URL validation/content negotiation and redirections to bring our grade up to an A. 


SERVER : A, https and certificates dealt with, utf-8, urls validated, content nogtiation, cookies
     errors faced - so very many

<b> DATABASE : A </b> 

We have currently written some of the callbacks for inserting and updating the data in our database, and have manually created our database as well. We update user details when they create an account, and update data based on the products that they buy, have an orders system for buying products. We also plan to organise our database access in to a separate server-side module to bring our grade up to an A. To prevent constructing an explicit SQL string and making vulnerable to SQL injection, we parametised the way we insert data.
     
normalised to 3NF: multiple tables may not seem efficient, but done to allow for scalability of our website and ensure  no contradicitions. 

TO MOVE TO A+ 
: lots of data inserted, 
: high experiences,
: normalised data, 
: complex queries, 
: complex schema, 
: id numbers sorted with database, 
: insert and pull a lot of data
: experience with serialization 
: effective error handling in the db (no rows etc handled well server side) 

<b> DYNAMIC PAGES : A </b>

We have delivered dynamic pages by inserting data into templates on the server side, and have currently created a simple dynamic delivery system. We are using the handlebars templating engine to dynamically serve our HTML pages. We plan to do more of our own programming to organise it better and remove the redundancy of the headers, additionally dynamically rendering a logged in user's name depending on session id. As we have spent a lot of time researching this we expect this will bring our grade up to an A.

TO MOVE TO A need to just show that we're fluent, etc etc, errors handled dynamically 



**example issues to highlight** 
- login issues from db
- error handling from database
- parameters from the db 


**depth considerations**
- game
- product page
- basket system set up 
- log in across pages
- user sessions and cookies
- using req parameters 
- security audit for vulnerabilities in express
